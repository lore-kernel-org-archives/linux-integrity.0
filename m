Initially I'm hoping that files will simply come signed, providing
file provenance.  Anything else is gravy.

Existing kernels might not support the newer kexec_file_load syscall,
so packages are currently being built to try one syscall and fallback
to using the other one.  In this case, it has nothing to do with
quality control.
