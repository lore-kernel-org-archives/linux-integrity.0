Looking over the patch set, it seems like this should be okay with swap fil=
es=20
being used for hibernation, right? I don't see a reason it wouldn't work, b=
ut=20
I figure it would be worth directly asking.

The reason I am asking is because I am looking at integrating KDE's dynamic-
hibernate[1][2] to allow Fedora Linux to dynamically generate files specifi=
cally=20
for hibernation.

Obviously, this works fine in non-SB environments since lockdown doesn't=20
negatively impact power management there, but if this manages to make it ov=
er=20
the finish line in some form, I would like to be sure the approach is=20
compatible or can be made compatible.
