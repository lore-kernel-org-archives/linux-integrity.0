It skips the IMA_PERMIT_DIRECTIO test because it's already going to
fail: we're in enforce mode and we got an allocation failure and so we
can't audit this access (note: there is another allocation failure in
ima_audit_measurement() which is still ignored after this patch, so
maybe ignoring failures is ok; seems like it's not, though).

I'm not sure I really understand the rest of your message though. Can
you suggest what the patch should do here? Should we just ignore all
failures as before?
