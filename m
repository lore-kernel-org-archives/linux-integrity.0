One of this reasons why this is important is that ZIP files *also*
have an central directory at the end.  And in the case of the APK
files, there is an in-band signature block which is located at at the
end of the last file and the central directory, which can be located
by starting at the end of the file, finding the length of the central
directory, and then backing up to find the signature block.
