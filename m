There has also been discussion with this on the thread for patch 02/10.
"A Merkle tree hidden past the end of the file" describes how ext4 and f2fs are
proposed to implement it, and it describes the file format expected by
FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY.  But, at FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY time, a filesystem could
copy the verity metadata to somewhere else if it wanted, e.g. into a file
stream, and then truncate the file to its original size.

Afterwards, fs-verity doesn't really care where the metadata is stored.
Currently it does actually assume it's beyond EOF since it calls
read_mapping_page() directly, but that could be replaced at any time with
indirection via a method fsverity_operations.read_metadata_page().
We actually had such a method originally, but it turned out to be unnecessary
for ext4 and f2fs, so I had dropped it for now.

I will make this clearer in the next revision of the patchset, and maybe even
consider reintroducing ->read_metadata_page() to make it clear that filesystems
don't necessarily have to store the metadata beyond EOF.

Thanks,

- Eric
