I am assuming you are talking about the following patches - using
struct tpm_chip instead of chip number and this patch.

I won't be able to test if struct tpm_chip usage as I don't have
multiple tpm hw in one machine. In case of tpm rng changes I can test
only the lifecycle of tpm rng device. Is that enough? I feel my test
will be limited. Please provide your thoughts on this.

PrasannaKumar
