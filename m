I think so mainly because of the security reason you said above.

In addition, I think it is mandatory that the Android system partition
should also _never_ suffer from filesystem corrupted by design (expect
for the storage device corrupt or malware), therefore I think the
bit-for-bit read-only, and identical-verity requirement is quite strong
for Android, which will make the Android system steady and as solid as
rocks.

But I need to make sure my personal thoughts through this topic. :)

Yeah, I have seen the the fs-verity presentation and materials from
Android bootcamp and other official channels before.


Thanks for your kindly detailed explanation. :)
