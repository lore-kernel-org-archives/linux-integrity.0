Some minor suggestions occurred to me after I saw this part of code
again before sleeping...

1) How about introducing an iterator callback to avoid too many
ahash_request_alloc and ahash_request_free... (It seems too many pages
and could be some slower than fsverity_verify_bio...)

2) How about adding a gfp_t input argument since I don't know whether
GFP_KERNEL is suitable for all use cases...

It seems there could be more fsverity_verify_page users as well as
fsverity_verify_bio ;)

Sorry for interruption...

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
