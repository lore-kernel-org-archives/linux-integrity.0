What about an xattr not to hold the Merkle tree, but to contain a
suitable reference to a file/inode+offset that contains it (+ toplevel
hash for said tree/file or the descriptor/struct)?

If you also expose said file in the directory structure, things such
as backups might be easier to handle. For where the tree is appended
to the file, you could self-reference.
