It would be unusual for me to put your patch into a series unless I am
also adopting it. eg what happens if there are more comments on it?

Also, I wasn't sure what branch your patch was against since my tree
didn't have history for it either..

Sometimes the maintainer has to sort stuff like this out... :)
