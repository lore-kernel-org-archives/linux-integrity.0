Hi,

I've looked at the series and the slides linked form the recent lwn.net
article, but I'm not sure how fs-verity intends to protect against
malicious firmware (or offline modification). Similar to IMA/EVM, fs-
verity doesn't seem to include the name/location of the file into it's
verification. So the firmware/an attacker could replace one fs-verity-
protected file with another (maybe a trusted system APK with another
one for which a vulnerability was discovered, or /sbin/init with
/bin/sh).

Is the expected root hash of the file provided from somewhere else, so
this is not a problem on Android? Or is this problem out-of-scope for
fs-verity?

For IMA/EVM, there were patches by Dmitry to address this class of
attacks (they were not merged, though):

Thanks,
Jan
