This was actually my original approach, but I thought it might potentially
be useful to have a new encrypted-key type to be able to do verification of
parameters (e.g. key size) early.
Additionally, because the type is then encoded in the blob stored in the
file system (keyctl pipe), it'd be easy to spot incompatibilities in case
fscrypt internal data structures change, whereas without one can only rely
on the name of the key (key description), should such a change ever happen.

I've done that in v2 - I am generating the fscrypt_key temporarily on the
fly but haven't gotten rid of fscrypt_key altogether... Is that what you had
in mind?

I also haven't based it on your work mentioned above, would that be
preferred?

Cheers,
