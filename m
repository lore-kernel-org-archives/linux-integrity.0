This first patch also adds a bit of core logic in the
simple fsverity_prepare_setattr() which ends up being called
by ext4 later.

While I'm not too familiar with the vfs, as far as I can
tell  from inspection of Linus' git master is that pretty much any change (timestamp, hardlinks) ends up
calling notify_change() which calls the fs-specific one, and in
the verity case basically denies everything, right?

Previously I brought up many uses for "content immutable" files:
https://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=151698481512084&w=2

The discussion sort of died out but...did you have any opinion
on e.g. my proposal to use the Unix mode bits as a way to describe
levels of mutablility?

Let's say that your new _VERITY inode flag becomes "_WRITEPROT"
or something a bit more generic.

Do you have any thoughts on my proposal to reuse the Unix mode
bits to control levels of inode mutability?

For example, it seems to me we could define u+w as "hardlinks are OK".
There shouldn't be any reason ext4/f2fs couldn't hardlink a verity-protected
inode right?  Or if for some reason that is hard, we could disallow that to
start, but at least have the core VFS support _WRITEPROT inodes?
