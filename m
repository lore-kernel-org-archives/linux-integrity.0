Already applied to my master (bleeding edge) branch in order to
facilitate testing/review:

git://git.infradead.org/users/jjs/linux-tpmdd.git

I also rewrote the description of the updatesthat I did to this commit
to be more precise (see the commit msg in my GIT tree). If it turns out
that some klog would make a huge difference I'm willing to consider that
later but lets go with this for now.

I'll also send an updated tpm_buf patch set with this one dropped soon.
