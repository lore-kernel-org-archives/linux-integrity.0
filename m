I think you deal with the existed cases quite well, I was just thinking about EROFS... :)

Thanks for your information about fs-verity, that is quite useful for us
Actually, I was worrying about that these months...  :)

I haven't look into all patches, I will look into that carefully if I finish my current job.
It is wonderful to have such a helper --- fsverity_verify_page :)

I have no other problem currently, and look forward for your final implementation.
