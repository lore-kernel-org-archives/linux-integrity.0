Well, it's up to the user of fs-verity.

If you know that, say, /bin/sh is supposed to have a fs-verity file measurement
of sha256:01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b, then
you can just check that.

Or, after IMA support is added, users will be able to configure the fs-verity
measurements to go into the IMA measurement log and/or audit log, just regular
file hashes.  Those records include both the file path and hash.

On the other hand, if the policy you want to enforce is just that a particular
file is using fs-verity and that its hash has been signed by a particular key,
then indeed, if there are multiple hashes that were signed with that key, an
attacker can replace the contents with a different signed contents.  But that's
not really fs-verity's fault; it's really the type of policy that the user chose
to use on top of it, as part of their overall system security architecture.

Yes, the initial plan for Android APK verification is to just use that type of
policy, probably using the in-kernel signature verification support included in
patch 07/10.  So it will therefore have that limitation.  Still, it will be a
massive improvement over the status quo where attackers can make arbitrary
changes to APK files post-installation, e.g. to persistently inject arbitrary
malware.

It will also be possible to improve the security properties of APK verification
in the future by doing additional checks, such as optionally including
additional file metadata in the fs-verity measurement (fs-verity's design allows
for this; they can be added as authenticated extensions), or even simply
checking for the correct metadata from trusted userspace code running in the
/system partition.  Or perhaps the trusted userspace code could download the
expected fs-verity measurement of the APK from the app store given the app name.
There are lots of options.  But we have to start somewhere, and fs-verity is a
tool that seems to be needed in any case.
