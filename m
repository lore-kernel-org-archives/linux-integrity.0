Clang is simply pointing out that this is explicitly undefined
behavior by the C90 spec.  As such, not only may the implementation be
different between compilers, but it is free to change between versions
of the same compiler (I haven't witnessed such a case yet in my
limited career, but I would never say never when it comes to relying
on undefined behavior).
