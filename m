After looking at this some more I'm having second thoughts about my
suggestion. As a distro we produce a kernel that needs to be flexible
enough for a variety of scenarios, and if we completely close off the
ability to load an unsigned kernel for kexec that's almost certainly
going to end up breaking some use cases.

So I think it is necessary to make this a run-time decision rather than
a compile-time decision. The patch as provided does this based on
whether or not the kernel was booted under secure boot. That might be
reasonable, though I still find this mechanism kind of awkward. It seems
like ideally there would instead be some logic that would accept the
image if the KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG verification had passed, and otherwise
require IMA signature verification.

Thanks,
Seth
