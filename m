Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Trusted Key policy for TPM 2.0
Date:   Thu, 20 May 2021 17:43:57 -0700
Message-Id: <20210521004401.4167-1-James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>

Now that the ASN.1 representation of trusted keys is upstream we can
add policy to the keys as a sequence of policy statements meaning the
kernel can now construct and use the policy session rather than the
user having to do it and pass the session down to the kernel.  This
makes TPM 2.0 keys with policy much easier.

The format of the policy statements is compatible with the
openssl_tpm2_engine policy implementation:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/openssl_tpm2_engine.git/

And the seal_tpm2_data command in the above can be used to create
sealed keys (including with policy statements) for the kernel.

The current implementation only has a limited subset of the full TPM
2.0 policy commands, but it is enough to implement keys locked to PCR
values and expiring keys.  The main missing feature is support for the
TPM2_PolicyOR statement, which means all current policy has to be AND
chains (key doesn't unlock unless every policy statement succeeds).

I can't fix the checkpatch error in the first patch: the thing its
complaining about is a sha1 sum, just not a sha1 sum representing a
kernel commit.
