Out of curiosity, I quickly scanned the fs-verity source code and some minor question out there....

If something is wrong, please point out, thanks in advance...

My first question is that 'Is there any way to skip to verify pages in a bio?'
I am thinking about
If metadata and data page are mixed in a filesystem of such kind, they could submit together in a bio, but metadata could be unsuitable for such kind of verification.

The second question is related to the first question --- 'Is there any way to verify a partial page?'
Take scalability into consideration, some files could be totally inlined or partially inlined in metadata.
Is there any way to deal with them in per-file approach? at least --- support for the interface?

At last, I hope filesystems could select the on-disk position of hash tree and 'struct fsverity_descriptor'
rather than fixed in the end of verity files...I think if fs-verity preparing such support and interfaces could be better.....hmmm... :(

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
