I'm looking into mainline support for CAAM-protected keys. I currently have
hacky patches that duplicate trusted keys, and use CAAM instead of TPM to
seal/unseal keys and make them available to other kernel features like fscrypt.
This patch by Udit Agarwal looks like an interesting base for my code.
However, AFAICT there has been no progress for some time now. 

Is anybody still working on this? If not, I'm happy to help out! :)

Regarding the new key type:
In addition to unsealing a key/data into kernel memory, CAAM also supports
unsealing a symmetric key directly into a key register of CAAM's crypto
acceleration engine. This is something I'd like to have, but it will surely
require changes the the CAAM crypto driver as well. Jan Lubbe already mentioned
he is interested in this too: https://www.spinics.net/lists/keyrings/msg03919.html

AFAIK, CAAM does not have fine-grained key release restrictions like TPM.
IMHO such a new key type should provide a generic interface with backends for
CAAM, TPM and possibly others to seal/unseal arbitrary data. As for supporting
keys that only reside in the HW, I'm not yet sure what the best approach would be.
It should probably tie into the crypto API to be usable throughout the kernel...

Thanks!
David
