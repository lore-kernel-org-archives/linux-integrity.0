This is online again in the master branch. 

I've mangled the commits as follows:

1. Fixed my emails to jarkko@kernel.org.
2. Adjusted the Makefile, i.e. separate lines for each entry.
3. Fixed the checkpatch issues.

I guess we could potentially re-consider this to rc2 pull? With all the
mangling required, did not make sense to include this to the first pull.
